Welcome to the weather generator repository !


The python scripts provided here are single-site and multi-site formulations of the weather generator. This weather generator simulates synthetic time series of rainfall, mean, minimum and maximum temperatures, wind speed, vapour pressure and sunshine duration at daily and hourly temporal scales. The input datasets used in this study are derived from a few sources which include - [Gauge based measurements]([url](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/datastore/eidchub/44c577d3-665f-40de-adce-74ecad7b304a/historical_hourly-rainfall/)), Gridded data sets such as [HadUK]([url](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/maps-and-data/data/haduk-grid/overview)) and [CEH-GEAR]([url](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/fc9423d6-3d54-467f-bb2b-fc7357a3941f)).
